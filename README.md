AirBnB Price Prediction Project

Summary
This project aims to predict the listing prices of AirBnB accommodations using machine learning techniques. It involves data understanding, feature creation, data quality checks, relationship assessment between variables, modeling, and insights generation.

Objectives
Analyze AirBnB datasets to understand the factors influencing listing prices.
Develop predictive models to accurately estimate listing prices based on various features.
Provide insights into the top predictors affecting listing prices.
Methodologies
Data Understanding and Feature Creation:
Load AirBnB datasets.
Clean missing values.
Create visualizations to understand the distribution of numerical variables.
Data Quality and Checks:
